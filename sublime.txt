Step 1: Download the Sublime text 3 tar file.

You can download the latest version from the Sublime Text website.

GO to http://www.sublimetext.com/3 then select the right OS to download ship over to the server using secure copy or sftp WinSCP.

In this case we click 64bit from Linux repos.

Step 2: Unpack the tar.bz file dowloaded:

tar xvjf sublime_text_3_build_3176_x64.tar.bz2

Once unpacked, you will see a directory called “Sublime Text 3″
Now move this folder to the “/opt” location. Type and run the commands below:

sudo mv sublime_text_3 /opt
Step 3: Create a symbolic link.

Now I will create a symbolic link to call “Sublime Text” from the command line as “sublime”.

sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text_3/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime
Step 4: Start Sublime Text 3.

To launch Sublime Text 3 from the command line, just type “sublime” .

sublime
